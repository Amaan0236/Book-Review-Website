# Book-Review-Website

Two things about me that I really enjoy doing - 
1) Coding
2) Reading books

This project is an extension of both of these hobbies of mine. It's going to be a website where after every book I read and finish I'll add it to the website, identifying the key points in the book, my favorite quotes from it, summarizing the book etc. 

More than just a project I can use and talk about on my resume this will serve as a good reminder of the insights Iâ€™ve gained from each book and a way to track my learning journey over time.
